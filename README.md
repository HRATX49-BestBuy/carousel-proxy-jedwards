FEC, Front End Capstone

This is the reverse proxy server I built for my front end capstone project at hack reactor.  I lead a team of 3 other software engineers over the course of this 3 week project.  Our task was to replicate the Best Buy product page both asthetically and functionally.  

Technology used:

    React, Hooks, JQuery
    Node, Express, Axios
    Material UI
    AWS S3, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS RDS, AWS E2
